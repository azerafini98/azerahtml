 <hr>
 <h2 style="color:blue;border:3px solid;background-color:pink;border-radius:20px">I have further my study at UITM Kota Bharu for 3 years on degree in Bachelor of Business Administration(Hons) Marketing and before this I am STPM student at TAN SRI MOHAMED YAACOB in 2016 and 2017.</h2>
 <h3 style="color:pink;border:1px solid;background-color:brown;border-radius:10px"> I am the youngest and I have 6 siblings including me. There are 5 girls and 1 boy. My sibling's name is Azwan, Alina, Aiyda, Azwani and Azmilah. I come from Tanah Merah, Kelantan. Neelofa is my wonderful inspiration and Rasullullah SAW.</h3>
 <h4 style="color:darkmagenta;border:4px solid;background-color:pink;border-radius:30px"> My previous ambition is I want to be a doctor. Unfortunately, I was unable to further my study on medic and I change my ambition to become a marketing manager when I further my study on marketing course. This course has taught me a lot of benefits and skills on how to become a businesswoman in my future. The most I love on marketing course is about the 4ps and decision making process.</h4>
